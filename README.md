# Natural Language Processing: How do powerful women communicate their ideas through Twitter?

## Scope

Powerful means having the ability to control or influence people or things. We all have a powerfull person that help us navugate through life and is usually a role model. It can be a mom, a dad, a friend and sometimes a celebrity that we love and admire.
I am interested in how powerful women communicate through Twitter and what language they use. Is there a pattern? Are they using the same words or close? What is special about these women communication? and what if we can recommend to other people how to speak like a powerful woman.
